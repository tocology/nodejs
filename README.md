# NodeJS

This repository is for helping how to make web application using Nodejs.

## Development

### Preperation

Basically, Nodejs is used as already mentioned. So, we need to install nodejs first.

For getting information about how to install, please visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Build

```console
> npm install
```

### Test

- **BasicRouter**

In this example, we do not use `route` module for routing user access. 

Alternatively, we try to make `route` by ourselves.

Futhermore, I recommend [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop) 
which is one of Chrome Web Application when we need to test POST method API.

```console
> node example/BasicRouter.js
```

- **Static Web Server**
